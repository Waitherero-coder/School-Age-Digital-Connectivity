# 📑 School-Age Digital Connectivity Analysis

Analysis of school-age digital connectivity across regions, using Python visualizations and insights.

## Project Overview

This project explores connectivity data for school-aged children, focusing on:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- **Visualizations:** Boxplots, scatter plots and barplots  
- **Insights:** Regional differences in digital connectivity, urban vs rural differences, and income-related trends  
- **Optional Analysis:** Grouping by income, urban/rural, or school type  

## Files

- `school_connectivity_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing all code, visualizations, and analysis.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.  
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and plots.

## Insights from Visualizations

### 1. Barplot – Average Connectivity by Income Group
- Higher-income groups generally have **better digital connectivity**.  
- Lower-income groups show **lower average connectivity**, highlighting inequality in access.  
- This visualization makes it easy to **compare connectivity across income levels** at a glance.

### 2. Scatterplot – Rural vs Urban Connectivity
- Urban schools tend to have **higher connectivity** compared to rural schools.  
- Rural schools show more **variability**, indicating inconsistent access.  
- The scatterplot helps identify **gaps between rural and urban areas** that could inform interventions.

### 3. Boxplot – Distribution of Connectivity by Region
- Some regions show **wide variation** in connectivity, while others are more consistent.  
- Outliers indicate schools with **exceptionally high or low connectivity**.  
- Boxplots summarize **median, quartiles, and spread**, making regional disparities clear.

### Overall Observation
- **Income level, urban/rural status, and region** all impact digital connectivity among school-aged children.  
- Visualizations help highlight areas where **interventions or resource allocation** could improve access.  
- The dataset is useful for **policy planning, research, and tracking digital equity**.
